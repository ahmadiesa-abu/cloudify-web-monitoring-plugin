cloudify-web-monitoring-plugin
===================


# Description

A Cloudify Plugin that monitor a URL response time and based on metrics will trigger scale up or down

## Node types

### cloudify.nodes.monitoring.Monitor - implements monitoring logic
#### Properties
- deployment_id - Deployment ID to execute scale workflow for
- scalable_entity_name - scaling group or node id that will be scaled by scale workflow. This should be defined in the blueprint used for target deployment defined in deployment_id
- delta - scaing step (number of instances to add or remove during a single scaling workflow execution)
h
- url - URL to monitor the response time for
- low_threshold - url response miliseconds threshold below which a scale down will be triggered (if there is more than 1 instance)
- high_threshold - url response miliseconds threshold above which a scale down will be triggered (if the scaleout_limit is not reached)
- scaleup_cooldown - minutes to wait in between scaleups
- scaledown_cooldown - minutes to wait in between scaldowns
- interval - minutes URL monitoring interval. The workflow that performs URL check will be sheduled with this rate
- scaleout_limit - maximum number of scale out workflows to execute in a sequence e.g. when scale out is called a counter is incremented and compared to this value. When scale down is called the conter is decremented
- client - optional Cloudfiy REST configuration
